### Step 1: Database Schema - Multi-Company Foundation
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Started**: 2025-01-15
**Completed**: 2025-01-15

**Goal**: Create new database schema for multi-company payment system

**Tasks**:
- ✅ Create `companies` table
- ✅ Create `payments` table (PrivatBank incoming payments)
- ✅ Create `receipts` table (Checkbox fiscal receipts)
- ✅ Create `users` table
- ✅ Remove/archive old transactions table
- ✅ Rewrite `scripts/init-db.ts` with new schema

**Testing Checklist**:
- [x] Run `npm run init-db` successfully
- [x] Insert 2 test companies via SQL (automated in script)
- [x] Verify foreign key constraints work
- [x] Check indexes created properly
- [x] Insert sample payment → verify company link works

**User Verification Instructions**:
Run this command to verify Step 1:
```bash
npm run verify-step1
```

This will check:
- All tables exist (users, companies, payments, receipts)
- Table structures are correct
- Sample companies are in database
- Payments are linked to companies
- Foreign key constraints work
- Indexes are created
- Data isolation between companies works
- Receipt linkage is correct

**Manual verification (optional)**:
You can also check the database directly by creating a query file or using a tool like pgAdmin/DBeaver:
- Connect to your Postgres database using `POSTGRES_URL` from `.env.local`
- Run: `SELECT * FROM companies;` - Should see 2 test companies
- Run: `SELECT * FROM payments;` - Should see 5 payments
- Run: `SELECT * FROM receipts;` - Should see 1 receipt
- Verify each payment has a `company_id` that matches a company

**Expected Results**:
- ✓ 2 companies with Ukrainian names
- ✓ 5 payments total (3 for company 1, 2 for company 2)
- ✓ 1 issued receipt
- ✓ 4 pending payments (receipt_issued = false)
- ✓ All foreign keys working

**Notes**:
- Old transactions table renamed to `transactions_old_backup`
- Created 4 tables: users, companies, payments, receipts
- Created 5 indexes for optimized queries
- Sample data: 2 companies, 5 payments, 1 receipt
- 4 pending receipts for testing Step 6
- All foreign key constraints working correctly

### Step 2: Simple Authentication System
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Started**: 2025-01-15
**Completed**: 2025-01-15

**Goal**: Single-user login with JWT

**Tasks**:
- ✅ Install dependencies (bcrypt, jose, zod)
- ✅ Create `lib/auth.ts` utility
- ✅ Create `/api/auth/login` route
- ✅ Create `/api/auth/register` route
- ✅ Create `middleware.ts` for JWT verification
- ✅ Create `/login` page
- ✅ Update `app/layout.tsx` for auth redirect

**Testing Checklist**:
- [x] Create user via `/api/auth/register`
- [x] Login via `/login` page → receive token
- [x] Token stored in localStorage
- [x] Try accessing protected API without token → 401 error
- [x] Access protected API with token → works
- [x] Refresh page → still authenticated
- [x] Clear localStorage → redirected to login

**User Verification Instructions**:
After Step 2 is complete, verify with these steps:

1. **Test user registration**:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should be redirected to `/login`
   - Use browser console or Postman to POST to `/api/auth/register`:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "admin@test.com",
       "password": "test123",
       "name": "Admin User"
     }
     ```
   - Should receive success response

2. **Test login page**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
   - Enter email: `admin@test.com`, password: `test123`
   - Click login → should redirect to main page
   - Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → should see JWT token

3. **Test authentication**:
   - Try accessing `http://localhost:3000/api/companies` in browser (should fail with 401)
   - Add Authorization header with token → should work
   - Close browser and reopen → should still be logged in

4. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, name, created_at FROM users;
   ```
   Should see your created user with hashed password

**Expected Results**:
- ✓ Login page exists and works
- ✓ JWT token stored in localStorage
- ✓ Protected API routes reject requests without token
- ✓ Protected API routes accept requests with valid token
- ✓ User persists in database

**Notes**:
- Authentication routes created: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`
- Middleware protects all `/api/*` routes except auth endpoints
- JWT token expires in 7 days
- Login page uses Ukrainian language
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Password hashing uses bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- Build completed successfully
- Fixed Edge Runtime issue by separating JWT utilities (`lib/jwt.ts`) from bcrypt (`lib/auth.ts`)
- Middleware now only imports `lib/jwt.ts` (Edge Runtime compatible)

          checkbox_license_key_encrypted
   FROM companies;
   ```
   - Verify encrypted fields are NOT readable plain text
   - Should see encrypted strings (not "test_token_123")

4. **Test company edit**:
   - In `/settings`, click edit on a company
   - Change name → save
   - Refresh page → name should be updated

5. **Test API endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Get all companies (with auth token)
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/companies \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

   # Should return array of companies
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- ✓ Settings page shows company management UI
- ✓ Can add new companies
- ✓ Company selector works on main page
- ✓ Credentials are encrypted in database
- ✓ Can edit and delete companies
- ✓ API returns companies filtered by authentication

**Notes**:
